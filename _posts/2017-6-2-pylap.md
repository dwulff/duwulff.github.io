New software! **pylap** (python language processing) is a graphical user interface written using python's tkinter library. It has been created to enable semi-automaized spelling correction and processing of human language data. It incorporates a simple spelling correction algorithm based on Peter Norvig's work (http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html), and the Snowball stemmer of Python's nltk library (http://www.nltk.org/).
