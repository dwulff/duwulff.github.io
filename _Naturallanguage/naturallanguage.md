Seminar, Dienstags, 14.15-15.45, Seminarraum 11

## Seminar structure

This seminar with exercises will teach you how to use natural language to inform psychological questions. With the rise of computers and the Internet, natural language has become an accessible tool for psychological research. Resources such as the microblogging service twitter and open-source pro-gramming libraries in R and Python enable researchers to use natural language to address psychological questions. This seminar consists of learning about natural language processing through introductory presentation and exercising the acquired knowledge in practical programming exercises in R. You will learn how to extract natural language from the Internet, how to process it using common natural language processing libraries in R, and how then to use the result to address psychological questions. 

Seminar sessions begin with a 10 to 30 minute introductory presentation and the rest of the time students work on their programming assignment. To pass the seminar students must hand each week's programming assignment until Sunday 11:59pm. Attendance is recommended, but not required.
