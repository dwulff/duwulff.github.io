I am a researcher at the Center for Cognitive and Decision Science, University of Basel, Switzrland, and an adjunct researcher at the Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human, Germany.

My research focuses broadly on modeling human cognition. More specifically, I have worked on decisions from experience and decisions under uncertainty, semantic networks and their development across the liefspan, search processes in external and internal environments, and hand- and mouse-tracking methodologies.
